# Missonary-and-Cannibals-Problem
three missionaries and three cannibals must cross a river using a boat which can carry at most two people, under the constraint that, for both banks, that the missionaries present on the bank cannot be outnumbered by cannibals. The boat cannot cross the river by itself with no people on board.

Details:

Here, the player needs to enter no.of missionaries and no.of cannibals to cross the river(left to right or right to left).if no.of cannibals exceeded missionaries on any side of the river  the terminal shows “~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~YOU LOST!!~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~”
If all the missionaries and cannibals reached right side of the river the terminal shows “~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~YOU WON!!~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~”
